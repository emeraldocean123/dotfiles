## Security Monitoring Process

### Quarterly Review (Recommended)
1. **Check for Security Advisories:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/security/advisories
   - Check Microsoft Security Response Center: https://msrc.microsoft.com/

2. **Version Comparison:**
   - Compare current 2.4.1 with latest stable release
   - Review release notes for security fixes

3. **Update Decision Matrix:**
   | Scenario | Action |
   |----------|--------|
   | Critical security vulnerability in 2.4.1 | Update immediately |
   | Major security fix available | Plan update within 30 days |
   | Minor security improvements | Consider during next maintenance |
   | No security issues | Continue with current version |

### Update Process (If Required)
1. Download latest stable PSReadLine from PowerShell Gallery
2. Test thoroughly in isolated environment
3. Update version in `modules/PSReadLine/`
4. Update documentation (README.md, bootstrap scripts)
5. Test bootstrap process on clean system

### Monitoring Schedule
- **Q1:** January security review
- **Q2:** April security review  
- **Q3:** July security review
- **Q4:** October security review

## Trade-off Rationale
**Stability vs Security:** Vendoring provides predictable, stable behavior across all environments at the cost of manual security monitoring. This trade-off is acceptable for personal dotfiles where stability is prioritized and security monitoring is manageable.
